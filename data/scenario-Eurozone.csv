Eurozone,2027-03-01,,0.5,1,1,1,2,"Interest rates converge on a rate similar to the expected inflation rate and lower than nominal GDP, due to stronger public finances and lower potential growth rates. The path towards these rates might be bumpy with long periods outside the range. Hence the low probability for a central scenario",Stronger growth or a growing lack of confidence in Eurozone public finances would require a higher neutral interest rate. Strong growth because plentiful potential alternative investments allows savers to demand higher returns and weak public finances because government needs to attract more savings,"Weak growth and persistently low investment generates few outside options for savings, helping the longer-term interest rate to fall to low levels."
