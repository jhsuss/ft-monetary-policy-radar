Eurozone,2024-07-01,3.75,3.5,0.25,0,0.25,,Our view has changed since our last round of projections in May. We now think the ECB will hold in July rather than cut for a second consecutive meeting. This is following an upward revision to the ECB's inflation forecast and higher than expected realised inflation in May & wage growth for Q1. The data dependent ECB thus moves more slowly than previously thought.,"Wage growth accelerates strongly, and household demand picks up substantially, causing an embarassing return to higher rates.",Sudden weakness in economic activity forces the ECB to rip up previous plans and sharply reduce rates in July

Inflation is still expected to be above target by this point (forecasted to be 2.6%), economic growth and labour markets have been more resilient than expected, but the ECB will proceed as it remains comfortable in its inflation forecast (conditioned on market expectations of 3 cuts total in 2024) showing inflation falling back to about target reduction in 2025.",ECB policymakers move slower on fears of insufficient progress on inflation or excessive exchange rate market reaction to earlier cuts,Euro area activity slows down significantly further because of weakening demand

Eurozone,2026-09-01,,0.5,1,1,1,2,"Interest rates converge on a rate similar to the expected inflation rate and lower than nominal GDP, due to stronger public finances and lower potential growth rates. The path towards these rates might be bumpy with long periods outside the range. Hence the low probability for a central scenario",Stronger growth or a growing lack of confidence in Eurozone public finances would require a higher neutral interest rate. Strong growth because plentiful potential alternative investments allows savers to demand higher returns and weak public finances because government needs to attract more savings,"Weak growth and persistently low investment generates few outside options for savings, helping the longer-term interest rate to fall to low levels."
