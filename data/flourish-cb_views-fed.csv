Austan Goolsbee,2024-07-18,<i>You want to be restrictive if you’re afraid of an overheating economy...The economy’s not overheating.</i>,Goolsbee suggests that the Fed has no reason not to cut rates.
John Williams,2024-07-17,<i>We’re actually going to learn a lot between July and September.</i>,"Williams suggests there is a need for more evidence, including more labour market data, to gain the confidence needed for a rate cut."
Christopher Waller,2024-07-17,<i>I do believe we are getting closer to the time when a cut in the policy rate is warranted.</i>,"Waller suggests that while a rate cut is not immediate, there has been sufficient progress to suggest that a rate cut is coming soon."
Adriana Kugler,2024-07-16,<i>I'm cautiously optimistic that we're seeing progress and the type of progress that we need to get back to 2%.</i>,
Mary Daly,2024-07-11,"<i>With the information we have received to date [...] I see it as likely that some policy adjustment will be warranted,</i>",Daly gives further hints that easing is coming.
Lisa Cook,2024-07-11,"<i>[M]y baseline forecast [...] is that inflation will continue to move toward target over time, without much further rise in unemployment.</i>","Cook believes a soft landing for the US is possible, forecasting that unemployment will remain low and economic activity robust while inflation returns to target."
Alberto Musalem,2024-07-11,<i>CPI inflation for June points to encouraging further progress towards lower inflation.</i>,
Austan Goolsbee,2024-07-11,"<i>The committee put out a statement saying, we would not anticipate cutting rates until we were more convinced we’re on a path to 2% [...] my view is this is what the path to 2% looks like.</i>",Goolsbee strongly signals that the Fed is poised to cut rates very soon.
Jay Powell,2024-07-09,<i>[Inflation] is not the only risk we face [...] the most recent monthly readings have shown modest further progress</i>,"Powell suggests that the risks to the US economy are now more evenly tilted, and gives clear indicatons that the Fed is nearly ready to cut."
John Williams,2024-07-05,"<i>Inflation is now around 2-1/2%, so we have seen significant progress in bringing it down. But we still have a way to go to reach our 2% target on a sustained basis.</i>",Williams believes it is too early to start cutting rates.
Jay Powell,2024-07-02,<i>[Inflation] now shows signs of resuming its disinflationary trend.</i>,Powell indicates that the Fed would be in a position to start cutting rates if US inflation continued its recent encouraging trend.
Thomas Barkin,2024-06-28,"<i>I'm open to the idea that r-star has shifted up somewhat. It is too soon to tell, but there’s one way to find out: proceed deliberately while keeping a close eye on the real economy.</i>","Barkin suggests that the netural rate of interest may have shifted upwards, meaning that today's high interest rates are not as restrictive as we would have once expected."
Raphael Bostic,2024-06-27,<i>I continue to believe conditions will likely call for a cut in the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of this year [...) the risks are becoming more balanced across our two mandate items.</i>,Bostic reiterates that he expects the Fed to start cutting late in 2024 but highlights the finer balance between the Fed's dual mandates of price stability and maximum employment.
Michelle Bowman,2024-06-27,"<i>We are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.</i>","This is a typically hawkish comment from Bowman, who added that she remained willing to raise interest rates if the data suggests that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."
Lisa Cook,2024-06-26,"<i>With significant progress on inflation and the labour market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy.</i>",
Mary Daly,2024-06-24,<i>[I]nflation is not the only risk we face. We will need to keep our eyes on both sides of our mandate—inflation and full employment—as we work to achieve our goals.</i>,"Daly points to the US returning to the flatter part of the Beveridge curve, with the job vacancies rate returning to normal. This suggests that continued restrictive policy may begin to push up unemployment faster than in preceding months."
Thomas Barkin,2024-06-18,"<i>We're clearly on the backside of inflation. But the question is, 'Are we all the way back?</i>",
