Lisa Cook,2024-07-11,"<i>[M]y baseline forecast [...] is that inflation will continue to move toward target over time, without much further rise in unemployment.</i>","Cook believes a soft landing for the US is possible, forecasting that unemployment will remain low and economic activity robust while inflation returns to target."
John Williams,2024-07-03,<i>The low r-star regime endures.</i>,Williams reiterates that he sees no evidence that the US netural rate of interest has risen.
Jay Powell,2024-07-02,<i>[Inflation] now shows signs of resuming its disinflationary trend.</i>,Powell indicated that the Fed would be in a position to start cutting rates if US inflation continued its recent encouraging trend
Austan Goolsbee,2024-07-02,"<i>If you just hold the rates where they are while inflation comes down, you are tightening - so you should do that by decision, not by default.</i>","Goolsbee suggests that the Fed can cut interest rates before inflation returns to target, as long as they are confident that it is making progress in the right direction."
Thomas Barkin,2024-06-28,"<i>I'm open to the idea that r-star has shifted up somewhat. It is too soon to tell, but there’s one way to find out: proceed deliberately while keeping a close eye on the real economy.</i>","Barkin suggests that the netural rate of interest may have shifted upwards, meaning that today's high interest rates are not as restrictive as we would have once expected."
Raphael Bostic,2024-06-27,<i>I continue to believe conditions will likely call for a cut in the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of this year [...) the risks are becoming more balanced across our two mandate items.</i>,Bostic reiterates that he expects the Fed to start cutting late in 2024 but highlights the finer balance between the Fed's dual mandates of price stability and maximum employment.
Michelle Bowman,2024-06-27,"<i>We are still not yet at the point where it is appropriate to lower the policy rate, and I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation.</i>","This is a typically hawkish comment from Bowman, who added that she remained willing to raise interest rates if the data suggests that progress on inflation has stalled or reversed."
Lisa Cook,2024-06-26,"<i>With significant progress on inflation and the labour market cooling gradually, at some point it will be appropriate to reduce the level of policy restriction to maintain a healthy balance in the economy.</i>",Cook highlights the importance of weighing up the balance of risks between the Fed's mandates on price stability and maximum employment.
Mary Daly,2024-06-24,<i>[I]nflation is not the only risk we face. We will need to keep our eyes on both sides of our mandate—inflation and full employment—as we work to achieve our goals.</i>,"Daly points to the US returning to the flatter part of the Beveridge curve, with the job vacancies rate returning to normal. This suggests that continued restrictive policy may begin to push up unemployment faster than in preceding months."
Loretta Mester,2024-06-24,"<i>At some point I would be open to selling, for the [Federal Open Market] Committee to sell MBS.</i>",Mester noted that the Fed's goal of balance sheet reduction may require it to sell mortgage bonds in the future.
Austan Goolsbee,2024-06-24,"<i>If you're going to be extra restrictive for too long, you're going to have to start worrying about what's happening to the real economy.</i>","Goolsbee said that he was ""closet optimistic"" about the outlook for inflation data, adding that very restrictive rates could start slowing down the real economy."
Austan Goolsbee,2024-06-20,"<i>If we get more inflation readings like the one we just got, which were very strong, very encouraging — looking much more like the second half of last year, around 2% —  then my view has been we can cut.</i>",
Adriana Kugler,2024-06-18,"<i>If the economy evolves as I am expecting, it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy sometime later this year.</i>",Kugler suggests that at least one cut is justified this year based on the economic data.
John Williams,2024-06-18,<i>I do see a disinflationary process continuing and I expect inflation to keep coming down the second half of this year and next year.</i>,"Williams believes the disinflationary progress will not stall later this year, as it did in spring 2024."
Thomas Barkin,2024-06-18,"<i>We're clearly on the backside of inflation. But the question is, 'Are we all the way back?</i>","Barkin, like many other Fed policymakers, needs more evidence of sustained disinflation before easing policy."
Susan Collins,2024-06-18,<i>It is too soon to determine whether inflation is durably on a path back to the 2% target [...] We should not overreact to a month or two of promising news.</i>,
Alberto Musalem,2024-06-18,"<i>I will need to observe a period of favorable inflation, moderating demand, and expanding supply before becoming confident that a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate is appropriate.</i>",
Lorie Logan,2024-06-18,<i>We're going to need to see several months of that data to really have confidence in our outlook that we're headed to 2%.</i>,
Patrick Harker,2024-06-17,"<i>If all of it happens to be as forecasted, I think one rate cut would be appropriate by year’s end.</i>",
Neel Kashkari,2024-06-16,"<i>We're in a strong position, but if you just said there's going to be one cut, which is what the median indicated, that would likely be toward the end of the year.</i>",
Jay Powell,2024-06-12,<i>Fifteen of the 19 [projections] are clustered around one or two [cuts]. I would look at all of them as plausible.</i>,"Powell downplays the shift in the median expected interest rate showing only one cut in the Fed's latest dot plot, softening its hawkish message."
John Williams,2024-05-30,<i>The behavior of the economy over the past year provides ample evidence that monetary policy is restrictive in a way that helps us achieve our goals [...] I don’t feel any urgency or need that we have to make a decision now.</i>,
Raphael Bostic,2024-05-30,"<i>My outlook is that if things go according to what I expect [...] I’m looking at the end of the year, the fourth quarter [...] to reduce rates.</i>","Bostic indicates that the Fed will only start cutting very late in 2024, according to his expectations."
Austan Goolsbee,2024-05-30,<i>What everybody is trying to wrap their head around now ... is are we back to the traditional tradeoff between employment and inflation?</i>,
Lorie Logan,2024-05-30,<i>It also may be that policy is just not as restrictive as we think it might have been relative to the level of interest rates before the pandemic.</i>,
Neel Kashkari,2024-05-28,"<i>I think the odds of us raising rates are quite low, but I don't want to take anything off the table.</i>",
Susan Collins,2024-05-22,<i>I think this is a moment or a period when patience really matters. I think the data has been very mixed [...] it's going to take longer than I had previously thought.</i>,
Christopher Waller,2024-05-21,"<i>Progress toward 2 percent has likely resumed [...] the data suggests that inflation isn't accelerating, and I believe that further increases in the policy rate are probably unnecessary.</i>","Waller suggests that disinflation is making good progress, despite having stalled in the earlier part of the year. This is an unusually dovish comment from the influential policymaker."
Christopher Waller,2024-05-21,"<i>If the data were to continue softening throughout the next three to five months, you can even think about doing it at the end of this year.</i>","This is a marginally more hawkish comment from Waller, indicating that his central expectation is for the cutting cycle to start only very late in 2024."
Michael Barr,2024-05-20,<i>Inflation readings in the first quarter of this year were disappointing. These results did not provide me with the increased confidence that I was hoping to find to support easing monetary policy.</i>,
Philip Jefferson,2024-05-20,<i>This lag suggests that the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to existing rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer.</i>,Jefferson is pushing back on Fed chair Jay Powell's narrative that low market rents are going to be an important source of disinflation in the near future.
