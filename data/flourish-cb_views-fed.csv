Jay Powell,2024-06-12,<i>Fifteen of the 19 [projections] are clustered around one or two [cuts]. I would look at all of them as plausible</i>,"Powell downplays the shift in the median expected interest rate showing only one cut in the Fed's latest dot plot. The modal expected amount of rate cuts is two, and Powell emphasised the uncertainty around those projections."
John Williams,2024-05-30,<i>The behavior of the economy over the past year provides ample evidence that monetary policy is restrictive in a way that helps us achieve our goals [...] I don’t feel any urgency or need that we have to make a decision now.</i>,"Williams highlights that he believes policy is restrictive, suggesting that no further hikes are needed. However, he also indicates that the cutting cycle will not start for several months."
Raphael Bostic,2024-05-30,"<i>My outlook is that if things go according to what I expect [...] I’m looking at the end of the year, the fourth quarter [...] to reduce rates</i>","Bostic indicates that the Fed will only start cutting very late in 2024, according to his expectations."
Austan Goolsbee,2024-05-30,<i>What everybody is trying to wrap their head around now ... is are we back to the traditional tradeoff between employment and inflation?</i>,
Lorie Logan,2024-05-30,<i>It also may be that policy is just not as restrictive as we think it might have been relative to the level of interest rates before the pandemic.</i>,
Neel Kashkari,2024-05-28,"<i>I think the odds of us raising rates are quite low, but I don’t want to take anything off the table.</i>",
Raphael Bostic,2024-05-23,<i>We're not past the worry point in terms of inflation getting back to our target.</i>,
Susan Collins,2024-05-22,<i>I think this is a moment or a period when patience really matters. I think the data has been very mixed [...] it's going to take longer than I had previously thought.</i>,
Christopher Waller,2024-05-21,"<i>Progress toward 2 percent has likely resumed [...] the data suggests that inflation isn't accelerating, and I believe that further increases in the policy rate are probably unnecessary.</i>","Waller suggests that disinflation is making good progress, despite having stalled in the earlier part of the year. This is an unusually dovish comment from the influential policymaker."
Christopher Waller,2024-05-21,"<i>If the data were to continue softening throughout the next three to five months, you can even think about doing it at the end of this year.</i>","This is a marginally more hawkish comment from Waller, indicating that his central expectation is for the cutting cycle to start only very late in 2024."
Michael Barr,2024-05-20,<i>Inflation readings in the first quarter of this year were disappointing. These results did not provide me with the increased confidence that I was hoping to find to support easing monetary policy.</i>,
Philip Jefferson,2024-05-20,<i>This lag suggests that the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to existing rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer.</i>,Jefferson is pushing back on Fed chair Jay Powell's narrative that low market rents are going to be an important source of disinflation in the near future.
John Williams,2024-05-16,"<i>I don’t see any indicators now telling me, oh, that there’s a reason to change the stance of monetary policy now.</i>",
Thomas Barkin,2024-05-16,<i>I still think there’s just a lot of movement on the services side and it’s going to take a little bit of time. I do believe we are on the right path here.</i>,
Austan Goolsbee,2024-05-16,"<i>[Inflation showed] some improvement from last time, pretty much what we expected, but still higher than we were running for the second half of last year.</i>",
Neel Kashkari,2024-05-15,<i>That’s an unknown — we don’t know for sure. And that tells me we probably need to sit here for a while longer until we figure out where underlying inflation is headed before we jump to any conclusions.</i>,
Jeffrey Schmid,2024-05-15,<i>I didn't really think we should have slowed the runoff [...] I think there was room to continue to run off like we were doing.</i>,
Jay Powell,2024-05-14,<i>We think that it’s probably a matter of just staying at that stance for longer.</i>,Powell pushes back again on suggestions that the Fed might respond to higher-than-expected inflation prints by delivering another rate hike. This dovish comment reinforces the tone of the most recent rate-setting meeting in May.
Mary Daly,2024-05-10,"<i>We are restrictive, but it might take more time to just bring inflation down.</i>",
Michelle Bowman,2024-05-10,"<i>I, at this point, have not written in any cuts [...] I’ve sort of had an even expectation of staying where we are for longer. And that continues to be my base case.</i>",
Lorie Logan,2024-05-10,<i>It also could be because the neutral level of interest rates has really risen […] we’re starting to accumulate evidence that might suggest that that level is higher than it was before.</i>,
Susan Collins,2024-05-08,<i>The recent upward surprises to activity and inflation suggest the likely need to keep policy at its current level until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2% [...] [I] believe this will take more time than previously thought.</i>,
Thomas Barkin,2024-05-06,<i>I am optimistic that today’s restrictive level of rates can take the edge off demand in order to bring inflation back to our target [...] I still have the weight going toward inflation and I think you can afford to do that when the jobs market appears as robust as it continues to be.</i>,
Jay Powell,2024-05-01,"<i>If [...] inflation proves more persistent than expected but the labour market remains strong [...]it would be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts [...] another path could be an unexpected weakening in the labour markets [. In that case,] you could see us cutting rates.</i>",
