Austan Goolsbee,2024-06-20,"<i>If we get more inflation readings like the one we just got, which were very strong, very encouraging — looking much more like the second half of last year, around 2% —  then my view has been we can cut.</i>",
Adriana Kugler,2024-06-18,"<i>If the economy evolves as I am expecting, it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy sometime later this year.</i>",Kugler suggests that at least one cut is justified this year based on the economic data.
John Williams,2024-06-18,<i>I do see a disinflationary process continuing and I expect inflation to keep coming down the second half of this year and next year.</i>,"Williams believes the disinflationary progress will not stall later this year, as it did in spring 2024."
Thomas Barkin,2024-06-18,"<i>We’re clearly on the backside of inflation. But the question is, 'Are we all the way back?</i>","Barkin, like many other Fed policymakers, needs more evidence of sustained disinflation before easing policy."
Susan Collins,2024-06-18,<i>It is too soon to determine whether inflation is durably on a path back to the 2% target [...] We should not overreact to a month or two of promising news.</i>,
Alberto Musalem,2024-06-18,"<i>I will need to observe a period of favorable inflation, moderating demand, and expanding supply before becoming confident that a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate is appropriate.</i>",
Lorie Logan,2024-06-18,<i>We’re going to need to see several months of that data to really have confidence in our outlook that we’re headed to 2%.</i>,
Patrick Harker,2024-06-17,"<i>If all of it happens to be as forecasted, I think one rate cut would be appropriate by year’s end.</i>",
Neel Kashkari,2024-06-16,"<i>We're in a strong position, but if you just said there's going to be one cut, which is what the median indicated, that would likely be toward the end of the year.</i>",
Jay Powell,2024-06-12,<i>Fifteen of the 19 [projections] are clustered around one or two [cuts]. I would look at all of them as plausible.</i>,"Powell downplays the shift in the median expected interest rate showing only one cut in the Fed's latest dot plot, softening its hawkish message."
John Williams,2024-05-30,<i>The behavior of the economy over the past year provides ample evidence that monetary policy is restrictive in a way that helps us achieve our goals [...] I don’t feel any urgency or need that we have to make a decision now.</i>,
Raphael Bostic,2024-05-30,"<i>My outlook is that if things go according to what I expect [...] I’m looking at the end of the year, the fourth quarter [...] to reduce rates.</i>","Bostic indicates that the Fed will only start cutting very late in 2024, according to his expectations."
Austan Goolsbee,2024-05-30,<i>What everybody is trying to wrap their head around now ... is are we back to the traditional tradeoff between employment and inflation?</i>,
Lorie Logan,2024-05-30,<i>It also may be that policy is just not as restrictive as we think it might have been relative to the level of interest rates before the pandemic.</i>,
Neel Kashkari,2024-05-28,"<i>I think the odds of us raising rates are quite low, but I don’t want to take anything off the table.</i>",
Susan Collins,2024-05-22,<i>I think this is a moment or a period when patience really matters. I think the data has been very mixed [...] it's going to take longer than I had previously thought.</i>,
Christopher Waller,2024-05-21,"<i>Progress toward 2 percent has likely resumed [...] the data suggests that inflation isn't accelerating, and I believe that further increases in the policy rate are probably unnecessary.</i>","Waller suggests that disinflation is making good progress, despite having stalled in the earlier part of the year. This is an unusually dovish comment from the influential policymaker."
Christopher Waller,2024-05-21,"<i>If the data were to continue softening throughout the next three to five months, you can even think about doing it at the end of this year.</i>","This is a marginally more hawkish comment from Waller, indicating that his central expectation is for the cutting cycle to start only very late in 2024."
Michael Barr,2024-05-20,<i>Inflation readings in the first quarter of this year were disappointing. These results did not provide me with the increased confidence that I was hoping to find to support easing monetary policy.</i>,
Philip Jefferson,2024-05-20,<i>This lag suggests that the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to existing rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer.</i>,Jefferson is pushing back on Fed chair Jay Powell's narrative that low market rents are going to be an important source of disinflation in the near future.
Susan Collins,2024-05-08,<i>The recent upward surprises to activity and inflation suggest the likely need to keep policy at its current level until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2% [...] [I] believe this will take more time than previously thought.</i>,
