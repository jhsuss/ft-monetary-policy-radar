Loretta Mester,2024-05-22,<i>[I need to see] a few more months of inflation data that looks like it is coming down.</i>,
Susan Collins,2024-05-22,<i>I think this is a moment or a period when patience really matters. I think the data has been very mixed [...] it's going to take longer than I had previously thought.</i>,
Christopher Waller,2024-05-21,"<i>Progress toward 2 percent has likely resumed [...] the data suggests that inflation isn't accelerating, and I believe that further increases in the policy rate are probably unnecessary.</i>","Waller suggests that disinflation is making good progress, despite having stalled in the earlier part of the year. This is an unusually dovish comment from the influential policymaker."
Christopher Waller,2024-05-21,"<i>If the data were to continue softening throughout the next three to five months, you can even think about doing it at the end of this year.</i>","This is a marginally more hawkish comment from Waller, indicating that his central expectation is for the cutting cycle to start only very late in 2024."
Raphael Bostic,2024-05-21,<i>It is in our interest to not start bouncing around...For me I'd rather wait longer to make sure that doesn't happen.</i>,
Michael Barr,2024-05-20,<i>Inflation readings in the first quarter of this year were disappointing. These results did not provide me with the increased confidence that I was hoping to find to support easing monetary policy.</i>,
Philip Jefferson,2024-05-20,<i>This lag suggests that the large increase in market rents during the pandemic is still being passed through to existing rents and may keep housing services inflation elevated for a while longer.</i>,Jefferson is pushing back on Fed chair Jay Powell's narrative that low market rents are going to be an important source of disinflation in the near future.
John Williams,2024-05-16,"<i>I don’t see any indicators now telling me, oh, that there’s a reason to change the stance of monetary policy now.</i>","Williams suggests that there is no immediate prospect for a rate cut, echoing Powell's stance at the May rate-setting meeting."
Thomas Barkin,2024-05-16,<i>I still think there’s just a lot of movement on the services side and it’s going to take a little bit of time. I do believe we are on the right path here.</i>,
Austan Goolsbee,2024-05-16,"<i>[Inflation showed] some improvement from last time, pretty much what we expected, but still higher than we were running for the second half of last year.</i>",
Neel Kashkari,2024-05-15,<i>That’s an unknown — we don’t know for sure. And that tells me we probably need to sit here for a while longer until we figure out where underlying inflation is headed before we jump to any conclusions.</i>,
Jeffrey Schmid,2024-05-15,<i>I didn't really think we should have slowed the runoff [...] I think there was room to continue to run off like we were doing.</i>,
Jay Powell https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-who-will-be-the-next-fed-chair/img/large/powell.png,2024-05-14,<i>We think that it’s probably a matter of just staying at that stance for longer.</i>,Powell pushes back again on suggestions that the Fed might respond to higher-than-expected inflation prints by delivering another rate hike. This dovish comment reinforces the tone of the most recent rate-setting meeting in May.
Philip Jefferson,2024-05-13,<i>I think it is appropriate to keep the policy rate in restrictive territory.</i>,"Jefferson appears to support Powell's view that the current policy rate is restrictive, and therefore that above-expectations inflation prints can be brought down without further increasing rates."
Austan Goolsbee,2024-05-13,"<i>There isn’t at this time much evidence, in my view, that inflation is stalling out at 3%.</i>",
Mary Daly,2024-05-10,"<i>We are restrictive, but it might take more time to just bring inflation down.</i>","Daly is suggesting that the start and magnitude of the Fed's cutting cycle will be data-dependent, and that there is no reason for it to start in the near-term."
Raphael Bostic,2024-05-10,"<i>It is going to take some time. For me the question, as opposed to how many this year, is when that first one will happen.</i>","Bostic suggests that the Fed may deliver only one rate cut in 2024, a hawkish stance. Bostic had been early in forewarning that inflation would come down more slowly than expected in early 2024."
Michelle Bowman,2024-05-10,"<i>I, at this point, have not written in any cuts [...] I’ve sort of had an even expectation of staying where we are for longer. And that continues to be my base case.</i>",
Lorie Logan,2024-05-10,<i>It also could be because the neutral level of interest rates has really risen […] we’re starting to accumulate evidence that might suggest that that level is higher than it was before.</i>,
Susan Collins,2024-05-08,<i>The recent upward surprises to activity and inflation suggest the likely need to keep policy at its current level until we have greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2% [...] [I] believe this will take more time than previously thought.</i>,
Neel Kashkari,2024-05-08,"<i>It seems like there’s more resilience in the economy than I had expected, so maybe [...] these interest rates only really mean we’re putting one foot on the brake and not two.</i>",Kashkari seems to push back on the idea that policy is sufficiently restrictive at current rates.
John Williams,2024-05-06,"<i>Eventually we'll have rate cuts [but for now, monetary policy is in] a very good place.</i>",
Thomas Barkin,2024-05-06,<i>I am optimistic that today’s restrictive level of rates can take the edge off demand in order to bring inflation back to our target [...] I still have the weight going toward inflation and I think you can afford to do that when the jobs market appears as robust as it continues to be.</i>,
Michelle Bowman,2024-05-03,"<i>Given the current low inventory of affordable housing, the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize.</i>","Bowman specifically points to the housing sector as a potential source of upside inflation surprises, contradicting Powell's view that housing would begin contributing to disinflation in the months ahead."
Jay Powell https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-who-will-be-the-next-fed-chair/img/large/powell.png,2024-05-01,"<i>If [...] inflation proves more persistent than expected but the labour market remains strong [...]it would be appropriate to hold off on rate cuts [...] another path could be an unexpected weakening in the labour markets [. In that case,] you could see us cutting rates.</i>","Powell is suggesting that there is almost no scenario in which the FOMC could raise rates again, despite recent data showing persistent price pressures in the US economy."
