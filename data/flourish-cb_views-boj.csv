Kazuo Ueda (governor),2024-05-08,"<i>It is necessary to be aware that, compared to the past, exchange rate developments are more likely to affect prices [...] If the outlook for prices is revised upward or if upside risks become high, it will be appropriate for the bank to make an earlier adjustment of the policy interest rate.</i>","Ueda is suggesting that further yen weakeness could accelerate the BoJ's rate-hike path. This is more hawkish than his previous statements on the matter, where he had downplayed the prospect of the BoJ playing a role in stabilizing the yen.",
Asahi Noguchi,2024-04-18,<i>The pace of policy interest rate adjustments [...] is expected to be far slower than adjustments by other major central banks.</i>,Noguchi wants to temper market expectations of a rapid increase in rates after the BoJ's early liftoff.,
Naoki Tamura,2024-03-27,<i>I believe there is a good chance of the virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing [...] it is crucial for the Bank to steer future policy conduct in order to proceed deliberately but steadily with monetary policy normalization.</i>,"Tamura thinks that the recent bout of wage-driven inflation will persist, which in turn will drive up longer-term inflation expectations and justify additional hikes.",
