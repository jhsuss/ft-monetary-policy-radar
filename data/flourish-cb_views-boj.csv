Shinichi Uchida,2024-06-21,"<i>Japan's economy is recovering moderately, although there are some weak signs [...] [we will] adjust the degree of monetary support [if the economy performs as projected].</i>","Uchida signals that additional hikes are forthcoming, although he maintains some data dependence."
Kazuo Ueda (governor),2024-06-18,"<i>There's a chance we could raise interest rates at our next policy meeting, depending on economic, price and financial data and information available at the time.</i>","Ueda opens the door to a hike in July despite the fact that details of the bond-buying program will also be announced at that meeting, although he gives himself some leeway by suggesting the decision will depend on the data."
Kazuo Ueda (governor),2024-06-14,"<i>It is appropriate to reduce the bond purchases in a predictable manner while also ensuring flexibility for market stability. If we are to start reducing [the purchases], we believe the size will be significant.</i>",
Ryozo Himino,2024-06-07,"<i>That's why we obviously need to be very vigilant to, and analyse very closely, the impact of exchange-rate volatility on the economy, prices and their outlook.</i>",Himino suggests that yen weakness may force the BoJ into a hike.
Toyoaki Nakamura,2024-06-06,<i>I'm not confident that wage rises will be sustained [...] My view is that inflation may not reach 2% from fiscal 2025 onward.</i>,Nakamura is a dove on the committee and his comments in a speech to business leaders shows he remains dovish.
Seiji Adachi,2024-05-29,<i>A monetary policy response would be one option if the impact on the achievement of the price stability target is predicted in the event that prolonged excessive yen weakness is affecting inflation.</i>,Adachi highlights that ongoing yen weakness is a factor that will play into the BoJ's decision of when to hike next.
Shinichi Uchida,2024-05-27,"<i>While we still have a big challenge to anchor the inflation expectations to 2%, the end of our battle is in sight.</i>",
Kazuo Ueda (governor),2024-05-23,<i>The data hasn't changed much our view on Japan's economy.</i>,"Ueda suggests that weak first-quarter GDP data has not changed the BoJ's fundamental outlook on the Japanese economy. This is a hawkish comment, which suggests the recent negative economic news will not derail additional hikes."
Kazuo Ueda (governor),2024-05-08,"<i>It is necessary to be aware that, compared to the past, exchange rate developments are more likely to affect prices [...] If the outlook for prices is revised upward or if upside risks become high, it will be appropriate for the bank to make an earlier adjustment of the policy interest rate.</i>",
