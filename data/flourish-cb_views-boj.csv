Seiji Adachi,2024-05-29,<i>A monetary policy response would be one option if the impact on the achievement of the price stability target is predicted in the event that prolonged excessive yen weakness is affecting inflation.</i>,Adachi highlights that ongoing yen weakness is a factor that will play into the BoJ's decision of when to hike next.
Shinichi Uchida,2024-05-27,"<i>While we still have a big challenge to anchor the inflation expectations to 2%, the end of our battle is in sight.</i>","Uchida suggests that Japanese consumers have permanently adjusted their inflation expectations, and that the Japanese economy is no longer in a deflationary equilibrium."
Kazuo Ueda (governor),2024-05-23,<i>The data hasn't changed much our view on Japan's economy.</i>,"Ueda suggests that weak first-quarter GDP data has not changed the BoJ's fundamental outlook on the Japanese economy. This is a hawkish comment, which suggests the recent negative economic news will not derail additional hikes."
Kazuo Ueda (governor),2024-05-08,"<i>It is necessary to be aware that, compared to the past, exchange rate developments are more likely to affect prices [...] If the outlook for prices is revised upward or if upside risks become high, it will be appropriate for the bank to make an earlier adjustment of the policy interest rate.</i>",
