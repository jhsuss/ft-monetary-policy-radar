Kazuo Ueda (governor),2024-05-08,"It is necessary to be aware that, compared to the past, exchange rate developments are more likely to affect prices [...] If the outlook for prices is revised upward or if upside risks become high, it will be appropriate for the bank to make an earlier adjustment of the policy interest rate.","Ueda is suggesting that further yen weakeness could accelerate the BoJ's rate-hike path. This is more hawkish than his previous statements on the matter, where he had downplayed the prospect of the BoJ playing a role in stabilizing the yen."
Asahi Noguchi,2024-04-18,The pace of policy interest rate adjustments [...] is expected to be far slower than adjustments by other major central banks.,Noguchi wants to temper market expectations of a rapid increase in rates after the BoJ's early liftoff.
Naoki Tamura,2024-03-27,I believe there is a good chance of the virtuous cycle between wages and prices continuing [...] it is crucial for the Bank to steer future policy conduct in order to proceed deliberately but steadily with monetary policy normalization.,"Tamura thinks that the recent bout of wage-driven inflation will persist, which in turn will drive up longer-term inflation expectations and justify additional hikes."
