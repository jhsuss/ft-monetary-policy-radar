Ben Broadbent,2024-05-20,If things continue to evolve with its forecasts – forecasts that suggest policy will have to become less restrictive at some point – then it’s possible Bank Rate could be cut some time over the summer.,"Broadbent signals that the Monetary Policy Committee is preparing to cut rates, although he stops short of indicating that such a move will happen at the June meeting. Broadbent is a dove, so this comment is in line with his usual lean."
Megan Greene,2024-05-16,"In considering for how long we must retain our restrictive stance before policy should be eased, I think the burden of proof therefore needs to lie in inflation persistence continuing to wane.","Greene is pushing back against governor Andrew Bailey's narrative that underlying inflation is falling. She indicates that March private-sector wage growth, which was in line with Bank of England forecasts, is not sufficient evidence that inflation is falling sustainably."
Huw Pill,2024-05-14,It’s not unreasonable to believe that through the summer we will begin to see enough confidence in the decline in persistence that bank rate will come under consideration.,Pill indicates that rate cuts are a realistic prospect over summer as long as no countervailing data appears. This is a shift from his previous and more hawkish tone.
Huw Pill,2024-05-10,We shouldn’t be seduced into drawing too much comfort from developments in inflation that are largely driven by factors that are external to us [but] we are taking some comfort from recent developments in inflation.,
Ben Broadbent,2024-05-09, I would look more closely at services inflation than wages over a short period of time [...] we do not have a very precise view on where Bank of England rates will end up.,
Andrew Bailey (governor),2024-05-09,[A cut in June is] neither ruled out nor a fait accompli.,Bailey is indicating that the decision to cut in June will depend on how incoming data turns out. He is open to a June cut but would change his mind if inflation remains persistent.
Dave Ramsden,2024-04-19,I have become more confident in the evidence that risks to persistence in domestic inflation pressures are receding.,"Ramsden thinks that underlying wage (and therefore inflation) pressures are weakening, which means cutting rates sooner rather than later."
