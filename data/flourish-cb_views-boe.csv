Swati Dhingra,2024-07-15,<i>Now is the time to start normalizing so that we can then finally stop squeezing living standards the way we have been to try and get inflation down</i>,"Dhingra calls to start easing policy at the August meeting, positioning herself as the most outspoken dove ahead of the decision."
Huw Pill,2024-07-10,"<i>[The MPC] should also remain cautious in seeing any single data as either a necessary or sufficient trigger for that re-assessment [...] in the absence of any big new shocks, the 'when-rather-than-if' characterisation of prospective Bank Rate cuts still seems appropriate.</i>","Pill remains uncertain around whether he will vote to ease in August or later, pointing to stubborn services inflation and wage growth but suggesting that cuts will start soon."
Catherine Mann,2024-07-10,"<i>We still see labor market tightness as revealed wage growth, that still remains well away from target consistent wage growth</i>",Mann is unlikely to vote to ease rates in August. She is concerned about persistent inflation stemming from above expected wage growth in the UK.
Jonathan Haskel,2024-07-08,<i>I would rather hold rates until there is more certainty that underlying inflationary pressures have subsided sustainably.</i>,"Haskel has been one of the more hawkish members of the MPC. In this speech, he notes that ongoing tightness in the labour market requires interest rates to remain restrictive for longer, indicating that he is unlikely to vote for a cut."
