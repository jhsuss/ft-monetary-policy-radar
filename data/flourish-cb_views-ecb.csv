Isabel Schnabel,2024-06-07,"<i>The future inflation outlook remains uncertain, we cannot pre-commit to a particular rate path.</i>",
Christine Lagarde,2024-06-06,<i>So what we’re doing here [...] is removing a degree of restriction [...] How long will that take? [...] I cannot tell you now. At what speed will it happen? I cannot tell you now either.</i>,"Lagarde and fellow ECB policymakers delivered a hawkish rate cut at there meeting in June. The president of the ECB stressed uncertainty in the path ahead, making the possiblity of another rate cut in July very unlikely."
Robert Holzmann,2024-06-06,<i>Data-based decisions should be data-based decisions.</i>,"Holzmann was the sole dissenting ECB policymaker, preferring to keep rates steady at the June meeting. In a statement to the FT, the Austrian central bank head alluded to recent higher than expected data on inflation and wages for his vote."
Fabio Panetta,2024-05-31,"<i>When defining the path of policy rate cuts, it should be borne in mind that prompt and gradual action contains macroeconomic volatility better than a tardy and hasty approach.</i>","Panetta suggests that the ECB should cut rates gradually but steadily. This is a dovish comment, since it indicates that policymakers should consider cutting after June."
Martins Kazaks,2024-05-29,"<i>As recession risks fade, barring a major surprise, the ‘insurance’ rate hike of September 2023 may now be reversed.</i>","Kazaks suggests that he sees the first rate cut as removing excessively restrictive policy, but doesn't indicate that further easing is necessary beyond this."
Klaas Knot,2024-05-28,<i>Policy rates will slowly but gradually move to less restrictive levels [...] projection round meetings of the Governing Council will be the key meetings for our interest rate decisions.</i>,"Knot indicates that the ECB will only consider cutting rates at forecast meetings, which would mean three cuts at most in 2024."
Philip Lane,2024-05-27,"<i>The overall direction of wages still points to deceleration, which is essential.</i>",Lane downplays the importance of a recent data release showing that euro area negotiated wages have grown more than expected in early 2024.
Francois Villeroy de Galhau,2024-05-27,"<i>I sometimes read that we should cut rates only once a quarter when new economic projections are available, and hence exclude July [...] Why so, if we are meeting-by-meeting and data-driven?</i>",Villeroy indicates that a July cut is still on the table.
Olli Rehn,2024-05-27,"<i>Inflation is converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, and the time is thus ripe in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates.</i>",
Piero Cipollone,2024-05-26,"<i>Based on these data, we now consider the three interest rate cuts in 2024 as the most likely scenario.</i>",
Mario Centeno,2024-05-25,<i>This real-wage recovery is compatible with inflation converging to 2%.</i>,
Madis Muller,2024-05-24,<i>I’m not too worried in the sense that I don’t think the trend toward lower inflation has necessarily been broken [...] but it emphasizes the need to monitor developments.</i>,
Joachim Nagel,2024-05-24,"<i>If there’s a rate cut in June, we have to wait, and I believe we have to wait till maybe September.</i>",Nagel pushes back on the idea of two consecutive rate cuts.
Luis De Guindos,2024-05-23,"<i>We have been very transparent about the decision at the June meeting [and] we are taking a prudent approach, which would argue in favor of a reduction of 25 basis points.</i>",
Francois Villeroy de Galhau,2024-05-23,"<i>We should not over-interpret, we keep confident in the disinflationary process.</i>","Villeroy underplays the importance of unfavourable data on negotiated wages, suggesting that a June cut is effectively a done deal."
Christine Lagarde,2024-05-22,"<i>The forecast that we have for next year and the year after that is really getting very, very close to target, if not at target. So, I am confident that we’ve gone to a control phase.</i>",
Isabel Schnabel,2024-05-22,<i>We’re currently seeing a slight revival of the economy in the euro area [...] there’s reason for hope that we’ll succeed in returning to price stability without experiencing a recession.</i>,
Isabel Schnabel,2024-05-17,"<i>Based on current data, a rate cut in July does not seem warranted [...] we should look very carefully at the data because there is a risk of easing prematurely.</i>","Schnabel explicitly pushes back against a second cut in July. This is in line with her usual hawkish stance, but it is notable that she is laying out her view more clearly, and earlier, compared to other policymakers."
Bostjan Vasle,2024-05-17,"<i>Unless we’ll get a big surprise, June is a reasonable, realistic moment to cut interest rates, but I can’t say what will happen after that [...] I’m open to different possibilities but I want to wait for more information.</i>",
Luis De Guindos,2024-05-16,<i>We have said very clearly that we are data-dependent and that we are going to have a meeting-by-meeting approach [...] I think that this is the correct approach. [...] Why? Because there is a lot of uncertainty.</i>,"De Guindos refuses to indicate whether the GC will vote for a second consecutive cut in July, which suggests that this discussion is still very open-ended."
Martins Kazaks,2024-05-16,"<i>Given that inflation will be moving sideways for most of the year, you should not expect some kind of action at every meeting.</i>",
Pablo Hernandez de Cos,2024-05-16,"<i>Every indicator points in the direction of a first rate cut in June, that would be our central scenario, as it looks like we could already meet our 2% inflation goal target by mid-2025.</i>",
Madis Muller,2024-05-15,<i>I would prefer to remain less specific and repeat the general message that ECB Governing Council members have carried.</i>,
"Pierre Wunsch (Governor, National Bank of Belgium)",2024-05-14,"<i>Higher U.S. interest rates could lead to a strong dollar and thus to imported inflation, i.e. higher prices here [...] that might lead to a slower pace at which we cut rates.</i>",Wunsch emphasizes the inflationary risks of divergence if the ECB were to continue cutting as the Fed held rates. This suggests that there is no consensus yet on the GC about the implications of divergence.
Frank Elderson,2024-05-10,<i>There’s no commitment at all beyond that.</i>,Elderson suggests the rate trajectory beyond June is open-ended.
Robert Holzmann,2024-05-08,"<i>We don’t operate in a vacuum. The Fed with the dollar is, figuratively speaking, the gorilla in the room.</i>","Holzmann underscores that the ECB is, at least to some extent, dependent on the Fed."
Boris Vujcic,2024-05-06,"<i>If the projections stand, as we see it at the moment, I would expect the loosening of the policy stance, but still staying in the restrictive territory to make sure inflation is brought down to the 2% level.</i>",
Gediminas Simkus,2024-05-06,"<i>My thinking is that there are some other interest rate cuts coming in the future, but I will restrict myself from elaborating on how many, even if I have already expressed that this year, I would expect three cuts.</i>",
