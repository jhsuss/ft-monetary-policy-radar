Luis De Guindos,2024-06-12,"<i>The level of uncertainty is huge [...] That's why, when you are in a dark room, you have to be very careful. You have to [...] move very slowly, to move with a lot of prudence.</i>",De Guindos reiterates the ECB's core view that it needs to see more evidence of progress on inflation before cutting again
Philip Lane,2024-06-11,"<i>While wage growth is set to be a primary driver of inflation in 2024, the net impact of labour cost increases on prices is being buffered by a lower contribution from profits.</i>",Lane explains what is driving the ECB's forecast for inflation for 2024.
Luis De Guindos,2024-06-07,<i>There will be months when inflation may even accelerate slightly but we are convinced that next year it will converge with the target.</i>,
Gediminas Simkus,2024-06-07,"<i>[If forecasts are accurate] there will be more cuts [...] when, at what speed, what trajectory — lets wait and see.</i>",
Francois Villeroy de Galhau,2024-06-07,<i>We will adapt the precise rhythm of our next rate cuts without hurrying or procrastinating as the outlook for disinflation is confirmed.</i>,
Joachim Nagel,2024-06-07,<i>[The ECB is] not on autopilot</i>,Nagel reinforces hawks' message that the ECB decision to cut in June does not necessarily entail that it will cut again in July.
Martins Kazaks,2024-06-07,<i>Victory is not yet in hand [...] further reductions in interest rates should be gradual.</i>,
Madis Muller,2024-06-07,<i>The central bank needs to make its decisions rather cautiously and not to rush too much with cutting the interest rate.</i>,
Isabel Schnabel,2024-06-07,<i>The future inflation outlook remains uncertain. We cannot pre-commit to a particular rate path.</i>,
Philip Lane,2024-06-07,"<i>The overall direction of wages still points to deceleration, which is essential.</i>",Lane downplays the importance of a recent data release showing that euro area negotiated wages have grown more than expected in early 2024.
Gabriel Makhlouf,2024-06-07,"<i>[Policymakers don't know] how fast we’re going to carry on, or if at all because — this is the phrase we’ve been using — ‘the road is bumpy.’</i>",
Christine Lagarde,2024-06-06,<i>So what we’re doing here [...] is removing a degree of restriction [...] How long will that take? [...] I cannot tell you now. At what speed will it happen? I cannot tell you now either.</i>,"The ECB cut rates for the first time at its meeting on June 6, but Lagarde made clear that the path ahead for rates is uncertain."
Robert Holzmann,2024-06-06,<i>Data-based decisions should be data-based decisions.</i>,Holzmann was the only voting member of the ECB governing council to vote to hold rates at the June meeting. He challenges Lagarde's narrative that the decision to cut was based on underlying data.
Fabio Panetta,2024-05-31,"<i>When defining the path of policy rate cuts, it should be borne in mind that prompt and gradual action contains macroeconomic volatility better than a tardy and hasty approach.</i>","Panetta suggests that the ECB should cut rates gradually but steadily. This is a dovish comment, since it indicates that policymakers should consider cutting after June."
Martins Kazaks,2024-05-29,"<i>As recession risks fade, barring a major surprise, the ‘insurance’ rate hike of September 2023 may now be reversed.</i>","Kazaks suggests that he sees the first rate cut as removing excessively restrictive policy, but doesn't indicate that further easing is necessary beyond this."
Christodoulos Patsalides,2024-05-28,<i>Maintaining optionality is key to successfully steering inflation to its medium-term targeted level.</i>,
Klaas Knot,2024-05-28,<i>Policy rates will slowly but gradually move to less restrictive levels [...] projection round meetings of the Governing Council will be the key meetings for our interest rate decisions.</i>,"Knot indicates that the ECB will only consider cutting rates at forecast meetings, which would mean three cuts at most in 2024."
Francois Villeroy de Galhau,2024-05-27,"<i>I sometimes read that we should cut rates only once a quarter when new economic projections are available, and hence exclude July [...] Why so, if we are meeting-by-meeting and data-driven?</i>",Villeroy indicates that a July cut is still on the table.
Olli Rehn,2024-05-27,"<i>Inflation is converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, and the time is thus ripe in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates.</i>",
Piero Cipollone,2024-05-26,"<i>Based on these data, we now consider the three interest rate cuts in 2024 as the most likely scenario.</i>",
Mario Centeno,2024-05-25,<i>This real-wage recovery is compatible with inflation converging to 2%.</i>,
Madis Muller,2024-05-24,<i>I’m not too worried in the sense that I don’t think the trend toward lower inflation has necessarily been broken [...] but it emphasizes the need to monitor developments.</i>,
Joachim Nagel,2024-05-24,"<i>If there’s a rate cut in June, we have to wait, and I believe we have to wait till maybe September.</i>",Nagel pushes back on the idea of two consecutive rate cuts.
Luis De Guindos,2024-05-23,"<i>We have been very transparent about the decision at the June meeting [and] we are taking a prudent approach, which would argue in favor of a reduction of 25 basis points.</i>",
Francois Villeroy de Galhau,2024-05-23,"<i>We should not over-interpret, we keep confident in the disinflationary process.</i>","Villeroy underplays the importance of unfavourable data on negotiated wages, suggesting that a June cut is effectively a done deal."
Christine Lagarde,2024-05-22,"<i>The forecast that we have for next year and the year after that is really getting very, very close to target, if not at target. So, I am confident that we’ve gone to a control phase.</i>",
Isabel Schnabel,2024-05-22,<i>We’re currently seeing a slight revival of the economy in the euro area [...] there’s reason for hope that we’ll succeed in returning to price stability without experiencing a recession.</i>,
Bostjan Vasle,2024-05-17,"<i>Unless we’ll get a big surprise, June is a reasonable, realistic moment to cut interest rates, but I can’t say what will happen after that [...] I’m open to different possibilities but I want to wait for more information.</i>",
Luis De Guindos,2024-05-16,<i>We have said very clearly that we are data-dependent and that we are going to have a meeting-by-meeting approach [...] I think that this is the correct approach. [...] Why? Because there is a lot of uncertainty.</i>,"De Guindos refuses to indicate whether the GC will vote for a second consecutive cut in July, which suggests that this discussion is still very open-ended."
Martins Kazaks,2024-05-16,"<i>Given that inflation will be moving sideways for most of the year, you should not expect some kind of action at every meeting.</i>",
Pablo Hernandez de Cos,2024-05-16,"<i>Every indicator points in the direction of a first rate cut in June, that would be our central scenario, as it looks like we could already meet our 2% inflation goal target by mid-2025.</i>",
