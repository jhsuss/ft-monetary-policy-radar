Joachim Nagel,2024-05-24,If the situation stays as it is now and the projections don’t say something completely different — but I don’t assume that — then the probability increases that we will see the first interest-rate step.,
Luis De Guindos,2024-05-23,"We have been very transparent about the decision at the June meeting [and] we are taking a prudent approach, which would argue in favor of a reduction of 25 basis points.",
Francois Villeroy de Galhau,2024-05-23,"We should not over-interpret, we keep confident in the disinflationary process.","Villeroy underplays the importance of unfavourable data on negotiated wages, suggesting that a June cut is effectively a done deal."
Christine Lagarde,2024-05-22,"The forecast that we have for next year and the year after that is really getting very, very close to target, if not at target. So, I am confident that we’ve gone to a control phase.",
Isabel Schnabel,2024-05-22,We’re currently seeing a slight revival of the economy in the euro area [...] there’s reason for hope that we’ll succeed in returning to price stability without experiencing a recession.,
Isabel Schnabel,2024-05-17,"Based on current data, a rate cut in July does not seem warranted [...] we should look very carefully at the data because there is a risk of easing prematurely.","Schnabel explicitly pushes back against a second cut in July. This is in line with her usual hawkish stance, but it is notable that she is laying out her view more clearly, and earlier, compared to other policymakers."
Bostjan Vasle,2024-05-17,"Unless we’ll get a big surprise, June is a reasonable, realistic moment to cut interest rates, but I can’t say what will happen after that [...] I’m open to different possibilities but I want to wait for more information.",
Mario Centeno,2024-05-16,"We should expect that, considering that the natural rate, the one that’s compatible with the 2% objective, is clearly below the current level of interest rates, that the path is of reduction during some time [...] I would prefer that it would be gradual, not sudden.",
Luis De Guindos,2024-05-16,We have said very clearly that we are data-dependent and that we are going to have a meeting-by-meeting approach [...] I think that this is the correct approach. [...] Why? Because there is a lot of uncertainty.,"De Guindos refuses to indicate whether the GC will vote for a second consecutive cut in July, which suggests that this discussion is still very open-ended."
Martins Kazaks,2024-05-16,"Given that inflation will be moving sideways for most of the year, you should not expect some kind of action at every meeting.",
Pablo Hernandez de Cos,2024-05-16,"Every indicator points in the direction of a first rate cut in June, that would be our central scenario, as it looks like we could already meet our 2% inflation goal target by mid-2025.",
Madis Muller,2024-05-15,I would prefer to remain less specific and repeat the general message that ECB Governing Council members have carried.,
Olli Rehn,2024-05-15,"If the confidence that inflation is approaching its target in a sustainable manner continues to strengthen, the restrictiveness of monetary policy can be reduced.",
"Pierre Wunsch (Governor, National Bank of Belgium)",2024-05-14,"Higher U.S. interest rates could lead to a strong dollar and thus to imported inflation, i.e. higher prices here [...] that might lead to a slower pace at which we cut rates.",Wunsch emphasizes the inflationary risks of divergence if the ECB were to continue cutting as the Fed held rates. This suggests that there is no consensus yet on the GC about the implications of divergence.
Frank Elderson,2024-05-10,There’s no commitment at all beyond that.,Elderson suggests the rate trajectory beyond June is open-ended.
Robert Holzmann,2024-05-08,"We don’t operate in a vacuum. The Fed with the dollar is, figuratively speaking, the gorilla in the room.","Holzmann underscores that the ECB is, at least to some extent, dependent on the Fed."
Philip Lane,2024-05-06,Both the April flash estimate for euro area inflation and the Q1 GDP number that came out improve my confidence that inflation should return to target in a timely manner.,
Boris Vujcic,2024-05-06,"If the projections stand, as we see it at the moment, I would expect the loosening of the policy stance, but still staying in the restrictive territory to make sure inflation is brought down to the 2% level.",
Gediminas Simkus,2024-05-06,"My thinking is that there are some other interest rate cuts coming in the future, but I will restrict myself from elaborating on how many, even if I have already expressed that this year, I would expect three cuts.",
Yannis Stournaras,2024-05-03,"Based on these data, we now consider the three interest rate cuts in 2024 as the most likely scenario.",
Fabio Panetta,2024-04-25,"If markets expect interest rates to drop but the Fed keeps them unchanged (for instance on the back of strong inflation data), the rest of the world faces an unexpected monetary tightening.","Panetta makes a sophisticated argument in favour of a more aggressive cutting cycle. Currently, Eurozone yields are being driven excessively by U.S. monetary policy expectations. The ECB must diverge in order to avoid importing tighter financial conditions from the US economy, which faces radically different fundamentals."
Klaas Knot,2024-04-18,It’s [...] not so clear whether the developments in the US will really have a meaningful impact on the inflation outlook in the euro area.,"Knot is suggesting that the risks of ECB-Fed divergence cancel each other out, and therefore the overall effect will be minimal. This is an unexpectedly dovish comment from a hawk, who might have emphasized the inflationary impact of a weaker euro over the disinflationary effect of tighter monetary policy conditions."
Francois Villeroy de Galhau,2024-04-14,I must stress that one of the advantages of having the euro is the vast domestic market that makes [us] less dependent on American decisions.,Villeroy underplays the risks of divergence and suggests that the Fed's decisions will not affect the ECB's policy trajectory.
