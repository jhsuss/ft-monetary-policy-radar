Joachim Nagel,2024-07-26,"<i>If the figures remain the same over the next twelve months, there might be a chance that we can reduce interest rates further at one or the other meeting.</i>",
Peter Kazimir,2024-07-22,"<i>We are on track to return to our target, but we are clearly not there yet.</i>",
Francois Villeroy de Galhau,2024-07-19,<i>Today the market expectations on the rate path seem to me to be rather reasonable.</i>,"Villeroy gives a strong signal that the ECB will cut rates in September, and potentially twice before the end of the year."
Christine Lagarde,2024-07-18,"<i>If that data actually confirms the disinflationary process that is at work in the moment, it will reinforce our confidence.</i>",Lagarde's comment suggests she needs to see more evidence in the incoming data to cut for a second time in September.
Fabio Panetta,2024-07-09,<i>Services prices tend to move differently from those of goods [...] careful analysis of the data can mitigate fears [...] it would be good if the pace of interest rate moves began to accelerate soon</i>,"Panetta suggests that stubborn services inflation need not delay the ECB's easing cycle, which in his view needs to continue at a sustained pace. This is in line with his usual orientation as a dove."
Klaas Knot,2024-07-08,<i>The next meeting that will truly be open again will be in September [...] we should not be thrown off our medium-term orientation if inflation comes in a bit higher than expected in some months to come</i>,
Philip Lane,2024-07-04,"<i>Domestic inflation is lower than at the peak around a year ago, but it’s still about 4%.</i>","Lane is concerned about persistent services and wage inflation, indicating that further progress on it needs to be made before centrist members of the governing council can start to cut."
Mario Centeno,2024-07-04,"<i>We should draw a path that doesn’t take us to go backward and forward, which confuses economic agents and therefore is damaging for credibility and for the way our decision is read.</i>","Centeno suggests that the ECB's easing path will be gradual and prudent, suggesting that rate cuts may not come at every meeting."
Yannis Stournaras,2024-07-03,"<i>For the moment, two more rate cuts this year seems reasonable and consistent with our forecasts.</i>",
Mario Centeno,2024-07-03,<i>I think we can look at every meeting and take decisions that give us the level of prudence.</i>,
Bostjan Vasle,2024-07-03,<i>Whether we cut in September or a few months later is an open question.</i>,Vasle implies scope for further easing this year but closes door on July cut.
Luis De Guindos,2024-07-02,"<i>Given the uncertainty we're going through, it's quite clear we don't have a predetermined path.</i>",
Philip Lane,2024-07-02,<i>We still have questions on services inflation.</i>,
Gabriel Makhlouf,2024-07-02,"<i>I think two cuts today, at the beginning of July, is probably going a little bit too far.</i>",
Madis Muller,2024-07-02,"<i>We should be patient and move very gradually, given the still high readings for core and services inflation and strong wage growth.</i>",
Pierre Wunsch,2024-07-02,"<i>If we have no major negative surprises, then based on our forecasts, I would say there is room for a second cut [...] a small deviation from the projections would not change this view dramatically.</i>",
Gediminas Simkus,2024-07-01,"<i>Expectations for two more cuts this year are in line with my own thinking, if data evolve as expected.</i>",
Fabio Panetta,2024-06-26,"<i>The ECB duly started this process [monetary policy normalisation] a few weeks ago and, in the baseline scenario, it will pursue it gradually and smoothly.</i>","Panetta suggest that ECB policy has reached a turning point, with further rate cuts ahead in the absence of any shocks."
Olli Rehn,2024-06-26,"<i>If you look at market data, it implies that there would be two more rate cuts [this year...] in my view, they are reasonable expectations.</i>",
Klaas Knot,2024-06-20,"<i>[The ECB will have to] wait for incoming data, including new projections, and then decide accordingly.</i>","Knot suggests that the next rate move has to take place at a projection meeting, meaning in September at the earliest."
Luis De Guindos,2024-06-18,"<i>[Projection meetings] are the most significant and interesting moments from the point of view of monetary policy, because our projections are a very important indicator when it comes to decide the evolution of interest rates.</i>",De Guindos suggests that future changes in rates are most likely at projection meetings.
Boris Vujcic,2024-06-17,"<i>July is always an option, but much more data will be available in September.</i>",
Francois Villeroy de Galhau,2024-06-11,"<i>As regards our next rate cuts, I plead for a pragmatic gradualism, both on the timing, without haste nor procrastination.</i>","Villeroy seems to suggest that a second consecutive cut is unlikely, but that the overall trajectory of rates is down."
Isabel Schnabel,2024-06-07,<i>The future inflation outlook remains uncertain. We cannot pre-commit to a particular rate path.</i>,
