Japan,2026-09-01,,0,0.75,1,1,1.25,"Interest rates converge on a relatively low neutral rate similar to the very long term JGB yield. The rate is low given Japan’s long history of difficulties in sufficiently raising inflation rates, which we expect to continue, albeit with less of a struggle than in the 2000s. The path towards these rates might be bumpy with long periods outside the range. Hence the low probability for a central scenario",A successful emergence from decades of weak growth and inflation would require higher neutral interest rates. A clear exit from below target inflation would need higher nominal rates to keep the same longer-term monetary policy stance,"Japan falls back into its low inflation trap, failing to generate domestic inflation and wage growth."
