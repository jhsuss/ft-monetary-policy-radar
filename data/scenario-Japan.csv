Japan,2027-03-01,,0,0.75,1,1,1.25,"Interest rates converge on a relatively low neutral rate similar to the very long term JGB yield. The rate is low given Japanâ€™s long history of difficulties in sufficiently raising inflation rates, which we expect to continue, albeit with less of a struggle than in the 2000s. The path towards these rates might be bumpy with long periods outside the range. Hence the low probability for a central scenario",A successful emergence from decades of weak growth and inflation would require higher neutral interest rates. A clear exit from below target inflation would need higher nominal rates to keep the same longer-term monetary policy stance,"Japan falls back into its low inflation trap, failing to generate domestic inflation and wage growth."
