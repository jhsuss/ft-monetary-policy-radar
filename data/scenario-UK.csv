UK,2024-09-01,5,4.75,0.25,0,0.25,,The BoE pauses rate cuts in September before continuing with easing later in the year.,The Bank of England expects services inflation to soften to 5 per cent by September. Insufficient progress towards this figure could justify a majority of the MPC voting again to hold rates at 5.25 per cent.,"If economic conditions deteriorate and inflation persistence fades, it is possible (though unlikely) that the MPC proceeds with back to back cuts in August and September."

UK,2026-09-01,,1.25,1,1,1.25,2.75,"Interest rates converge on a rate similar to the expected inflation rate and lower than nominal GDP, due to stronger public finances and lower potential growth rates. The path towards these rates might be bumpy with long periods outside the range. Hence the low probability for a central scenario.",Stronger growth or a growing lack of confidence in UK public finances would require a higher neutral interest rate. Strong growth because plentiful potential alternative investments allow savers to demand higher returns and weak public finances because government needs to attract more savings.,"Weak growth and persistently low investment generates few outside options for savings, helping the longer-term interest rate to fall to low levels."
