Hence the low probability for a central scenario.",Strong growth or a growing lack of confidence in US public finances requires a higher neutral interest rate. Strong growth because plentiful potential alternative investments allows savers to demand higher returns and weak public finances because government needs to attract more savings.,"Weak growth and persistently low generates few outside options for savings, helping the longer-term interest rate to fall to low levels."
